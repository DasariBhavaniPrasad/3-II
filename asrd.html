            <div>
                The Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) was established in 1998, along with the inception of the Sri Venkateswara College of Engineering and Technology (SVCET), with a sanctioned intake of 40 students. The annual sanctioned intake was later increased to 60 in the academic year 2001-02, and then increased to 120 in the academic year 2009-2010 and then got further increased to 180 in the academic year 2014-15. In 2009, the CSE department started a Master’s of Technology (M. Tech.) programme with a sanctioned intake of 18. Due to high demand for Computer Science professionals from the industry, M.Tech. (CSE II Shift) with a sanctioned intake of 18 and M.Tech. (CS) with sanctioned intake of 18 were started in 2011.
